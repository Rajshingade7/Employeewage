// Blocking:
// In a blocking operation, the execution of additional code is paused ("blocked") until the current operation completes. This means that the program cannot proceed to execute any further until the current operation finishes.



// Non-blocking:
// In a non-blocking operation, the execution of additional code continues even if the current operation has not yet completed. This allows the program to perform other tasks while waiting for the completion of the current operation.
